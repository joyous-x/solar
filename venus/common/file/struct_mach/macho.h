 * The layout of the file depends on the filetype.  For all but the MH_OBJECT
 * file type the segments are padded out and aligned on a segment alignment
 * boundary for efficient demand pageing.  The MH_EXECUTE, MH_FVMLIB, MH_DYLIB,
 * MH_DYLINKER and MH_BUNDLE file types also have the headers included as part
 * of their first segment.
 *
 * The file type MH_OBJECT is a compact format intended as output of the
 * assembler and input (and possibly output) of the link editor (the .o
 * format).  All sections are in one unnamed segment with no segment padding.
 * This format is used as an executable format when the file is so small the
 * segment padding greatly increases its size.
 *
 * The file type MH_PRELOAD is an executable format intended for things that
 * are not executed under the kernel (proms, stand alones, kernels, etc).  The
 * format can be executed under the kernel but may demand paged it and not
 * preload it before execution.
 *
 * A core file is in MH_CORE format and can be any in an arbritray legal
 * Mach-O file.

/*
 * The load commands directly follow the mach_header.  The total size of all
 * of the commands is given by the sizeofcmds field in the mach_header.  All
 * load commands must have as their first two fields cmd and cmdsize.  The cmd
 * field is filled in with a constant for that command type.  Each command type
 * has a structure specifically for it.  The cmdsize field is the size in bytes
 * of the particular load command structure plus anything that follows it that
 * is a part of the load command (i.e. section structures, strings, etc.).  To
 * advance to the next load command the cmdsize can be added to the offset or
 * pointer of the current load command.  The cmdsize for 32-bit architectures
 * MUST be a multiple of 4 bytes and for 64-bit architectures MUST be a multiple
 * of 8 bytes (these are forever the maximum alignment of any load commands).
 * The padded bytes must be zero.  All tables in the object file must also
 * follow these rules so the file can be memory mapped.  Otherwise the pointers
 * to these tables will not work well or at all on some machines.  With all
 * padding zeroed like objects will compare byte for byte.
